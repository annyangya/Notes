Salinger may have hated visitors, but he sure loved lawyers. The famously solitary author turned down all attempts by others to adapt his writtings, particularly his masterwork, Catcher in the Rye. But now that Salinger is gone, what will happend to his iron-fisted control over his writings? 

Precious little, say legal experts . But if Salinger had the foresight to invite a good estate planner to Cornish, it's likely that he will rule his literary empire from grave. But his death should have no significance at all. His works are in copyright , and remain in copyright .

Those copyrights pass to his estate. Salinger may have left detailed directions about how to proceed. If he says that he doesn't want a revised work, or a secondary work, or a derivative work, or he doesn't want to anything related to Catcher in the Rye licensed , whoever is managing his estate would be bound by that.

The judge sided with Salinger, indefinitely banning the publication of the book in this city. And the judge rejected the argument that the book was a parody , which would be legally permissible . The judge's ruling has been appealed to the second circuit , where the case is still up in the air.

But Salinger isn't above the law. In the future, Catcher in the Rye and his handful of short stories will have to go into the public domain, where they're open game. But don't hold your breath. That will be in 2080.
