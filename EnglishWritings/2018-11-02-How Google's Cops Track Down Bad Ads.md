The Internet is full of get-rich-quick schemers and many other big fat liars and they all try to get ads for their businesses to show up next to Google search results. They are sometimes even tagged as "Sponsored ads". Click on the wrong ads and you could encounter cons such as phishing, a wide range of get-rich-quick scams, and any other dishonest practice.

Shady ads have become such a problem for search engines that hundreds of Google employees work round-the-clock to protect users before they get ripped off. Today, Google earns about 95% of its revenue from advertising , so making sure its ads marketplace is free of illegitimate businesses is a big part of the search giant's own business.

Google employs a mix of machines and humans to catch bad ads. The first line of defense is software that searches for ads with specific attributes Google finds disreputable.Because automated systems isn't perfect, Google also relies on actual humans to determine some ads' legitimacy .

The engineers thought that the border that they were building had a fundamental flaw , and it was going to catch a lot of really good advertisers and frustrate them by either shutting them down automatically or delaying their ads.

As it turned out, the people behind the questionable ads were taking photos of cars parked on the street and uploading them to the sites to be purchased . Once a buyer emerged , the stole the car.

Baker says that while he believes that the problem of bad ads may be growing, but he knows that Google's detection systems are getting more sophisticated . And they are catching more ads. 

I have this aspiration that we will get so good that there is going to be an inflection point, where the bad actors realize it's not worth time and energy. But this is going to be a constant battle.
