It takes extra work to get in touch with me. I will keep my cell switched off unless I'm expecting to use it to search some information via the Internet. If I have my way, you should think twice before talking on your phones.

How safe is your cell phone?

As we all know, this device emits electromagnetic  radiation , exposure to which may cause brain cancer. Users, especially children and pregnant women, should keep this device away from the head and body.

For those of you now eyeing your cell phones suspiciouslly, it's worth noting that the World Health Origanization says there isn't evidence to support the assertion that the cell phones are a public-health threat.

Several countries like France have issued guidelines for cell-phone use. A man ,who began researching this issue when his wife was expecting their first child, is hoping his city will adopt legislation that would have manufactures print radiation information on cell-phone packaging and manuals and require retailers to display the data on the sales floor.

As the cell phones make and take calls, they emit RF radiation. But the goods news is that there are easy ways for those concerned about radiation to cut on exposure. Using your cell phone's speakers and connecting a wired headset——while keeping the headset away from your body——drastically reduces radiation. And given the potentially more serious risks for children , who have thinner skulls than adults,  parents might want to wait before handing teens their first phone, or at least enssure they use it mostly for texting.
