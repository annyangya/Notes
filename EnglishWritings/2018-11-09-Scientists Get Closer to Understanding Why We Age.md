Time waits for no man, the old going says, but in recent years, scientists have shown that it does seem to move more slowly for some. Researchers have observed that people's cells often age at different rate, leading them to make a distinction between chronological and biological age.

But the reason for the difference remains only vaguely understood . Environmental factors such as smoking, stress and regular exercise all seem to influence the rate at which our cells age.

Each time a cell reproduces itself , the telomeres shorten, like plastic tips fraying on the end of shoelaces. Shortened telomeres have been linked to a host of age-related illness such as heart disease and many certain cancers. Many scientists now believe that telomeres are the closest we may come to identifying a biological clock and our best bet for learning how to stop or turn back that clock.

Understanding the components that determine telomeres length may one day help researchers devise treatments for age-related diseases, particularly heart disease. I see in my practice 80-year-old with healthy heart and 40-year-old with heart disease. We may be on our way explaining the genetic components in the explanation for why this is so and so expanding the knowledge of disease and how to treat it.

We all probably develope cancer cells that don't get past a reproductions because of the effect of normal telomeres shortening. If you make cells immortal by allowing them repair to their telomeres , you may raise the risk of nasty cancers considerably.

The bottom line is that we remain a long  way from developing an elixir of youth, however tempting that goal may be.
